A Handibot tool is a new kind of portable, digitally-controlled power tool for cutting, drilling, carving, and many other machining operations– a first Universal Digital Power Tool (UDPT) – or just, a Smart Tool. If you're familiar with industrial CNC (computer numerically controlled) equipment, think of the Handibot tool as a portable version of CNC. But instead of taking material to a stationary machine, you bring the Handibot to your material -- your jobsite, your remodeling task, your project, your work.

Handibot App Development
========================
Handibots will be enabled by new types of job-oriented or task-oriented software apps. This repo contains information for those interested in developing Handibot Apps, both conceptual information and eventually, App examples.
